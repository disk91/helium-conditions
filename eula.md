#### General considerations 
Our service rely on the availability of the Helium Network infrastructure. Helium does not offer SLA for this
infrastructure. Helium itself rely on the availability of the hotspot offering the coverage, by design, as a crowd-sourced 
network, there is no SLA, no guaranty of any kind for the offered coverage.

As a consequence, SLA consideration is only concerning what IngeniousThings is directly operating: the Chirpstack instance
with the associated glue controlling the Helium configuration service.

#### :arrow_right: console.helium-iot.eu / console.helium-iot.xyz

We do our best to provide the best possible service for our customers. We will increase the availability level over the 
time following what the overall business generated by the service will allow us to offer to you. Helium network is a low
cost network and a large volume of sensors is required to offer your an industrial level of service.

The measured SLA will be soon accessible to an external public website.

##### `Standard Availability`
This service is best-effort, we do not offer any SLA guaranty. 

##### `Planned outage`
We can plan outage at any-time without prior notice

##### `Emergency operations`

usually for the reason of fixing the under-laying problem. 

##### `Data availability`
Our infrastructure is backup on every-day, up to 24h of data can be lost including the session key currently used by your
devices. You can be in a situation where you have to manually restart your devices if they have not been designed for rejoin.
We offer no guaranty of any kind about your device data and your device meta-data, any cost related to the data & meta-data loss
is under the responsibility of the customer in charge of handling these aspects at his device and application server layer.
Device data and metadata can be extracted from the platform API.

##### `API fair use`
API are fully accessible to access data and meta-data. Fair use limitation is fixed at 0.5 API request per second maximum per billing user calculated 
on an average time of 1 hour. Over this limit the customer account can be suspended.

##### `Disaster Recovery Plan`

#### `SLA Evolutions`

The SLA will evolve, based on service revenue, this service will give a priority on a low-cost service over service quality.
The SLA will evolve to the following Level (this document will be updated) on the following conditions:
- after 6 months of monthly revenue higher than the triggered value
- with a 2 months transition to the new SLA before it's active

| Trigger | Work day SLA | 24/365 | Monthly availability target | Yearly Target | DCs cost evolution | SR Response Time |
|---------|--------------|--------|-----------------------------|---------------|--------------------|------------------| 
| $3500/m |     Yes      | No     | 95% based on work hours     | 97%           | Not related to SLA | 5 work days      |
| $5000/m |     Yes      | Yes    | 95%                         | 98%           | Not related to SLA | 5 work days      |
| $7500/m |     Yes      | Yes    | 98%                         | 99.5%         | Not related to SLA | 5 work days      |

the given SLA goal. This is not a commitment on the SLA and there is no compensation to customer in case of goal miss. 

In any case, IngeniousThings will not be responsible for any impact you get on your service execution, whatever the consequences are for
your business, for your customer or for your users. By registering to our service, you accept the full responsibility of any consequence of

### DEVICE DATA

Data transferred to one of our service can't be considered as a personal or health or any kind of specific data. IngeniousThings
as a connectivity provider do not offer a specific protection to the data transported into our service coming from your
devices. 

As a device owner, it on your responsibility to provide the right level of your protection to the data you transport. A LoRaWan 
Network Server (console) is decrypting the device payload and process it in clear text. As a result the clear payload is processed 
and traces of these processing can stay on the system, logs and databases. You may encrypt from end-to-end your payload to protect your device data 
privacy as a state-of-the-art recommendation.

In case you have a such special requirement for personal data protection or health data protection, we can propose dedicated instances
of our service, isolated and secured at the expected level. Our cloud provider is certified for all kind of data and custom
services can be created for you. Contact us.

Data rate limitation can be applied to devices, it will not be below 800 messages in an hour, Join rate limit can also be activated with a 
value not below 60 in an hour. Device above these limit are subject to deactivation.

### OPEN SOURCE

Our different services are built on open-source software. LoRaWan Network server is running on Chiprstack project, the Helium
 network integration rely on disk91 Helium-Chirpstack project, this is also relying on helium open-source projects. Open-source projects
 does not provide industry grade support, conducting in certain delays to fix issues.
