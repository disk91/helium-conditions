### DEVICE DATA

Data transferred to one of our service can't be considered as a personal or health or any kind of specific data. IngeniousThings
as a connectivity provider do not offer a specific protection to the data transported into our service coming from your
devices. 

As a device owner, it on your responsibility to provide the right level of your protection to the data you transport. A LoRaWan 
Network Server (console) is decrypting the device payload and process it in clear text. As a result the clear payload is processed 
and traces of these processing can stay on the system, logs and databases. You may encrypt from end-to-end your payload to protect your device data 
privacy as a state-of-the-art recommendation.

In case you have a such special requirement for personal data protection or health data protection, we can propose dedicated instances
of our service, isolated and secured at the expected level. Our cloud provider is certified for all kind of data and custom
services can be created for you. Contact us.

### OPEN SOURCE

Our different services are built on open-source software. LoRaWan Network server is running on Chiprstack project, the Helium
 network integration rely on disk91 Helium-Chirpstack project, this is also relying on helium open-source projects. Open-source projects
 does not provide industry grade support, conducting in certain delays to fix issues.
